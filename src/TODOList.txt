//List of things I want to do in no particular order

-Fix make file to not compile everything

-Move testcode (like unit test and test_database and stress test) into a different folder
  -Design a system to allow for using the code from different folder so that engine code and game code dont get mixed

-Rewrite database to use skip list

-write more functions that create the message protocol for you, those look nice

-increase the number of database request types, i.e. more specific find methods(find float, find string, find float between x and y, find first)
  -see what can be done to make creating these easy, so they can be made as I need them
