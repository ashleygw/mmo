//List of things I want to do in no particular order

-Fix make file to not compile everything

-Move testcode (like unit test and test_database and stress test) into a different folder
  -Design a system to allow for using the code from different folder so that engine code and game code dont get mixed

-Rewrite database to use skip list

-write more functions that create the message protocol for you, those look nice

-increase the number of database request types, i.e. more specific find methods(find float, find string, find float between x and y, find first)
  -see what can be done to make creating these easy, so they can be made as I need them

-Remark(bug?), if a client is terminated then started up again before the connection is removed the server will remember the old port and will send to old port, but pings still work so it is a non-communicating connection
