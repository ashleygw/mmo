//List of things I want to do or bugs i want to fix in no particular order

-Remark(bug?), if a client/server shuts down then starts back up before the connection is terminated then reliable messages acks could be off for up to RESENDSIZE number of packets, which means the message will be assumed that it was resent and will ignore it but send back an ack saying its been seen, so the packet is essentially droped. To fix this I am going to make a reconnect message or something that will remove the connection then re add it
